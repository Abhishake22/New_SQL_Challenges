Question: Write a query to find the highest paid employee in each department.

CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmployeeName VARCHAR(100),
    DepartmentID INT,
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)
);


INSERT INTO Departments (DepartmentID, DepartmentName) VALUES
(1, 'HR'),
(2, 'Engineering'),
(3, 'Sales');


INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, EmployeeName, DepartmentID, Salary) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 1, 70000.00),
(2, 'Bob', 1, 80000.00),
(3, 'Charlie', 2, 120000.00),
(4, 'Dave', 2, 110000.00),
(5, 'Eve', 3, 90000.00),
(6, 'Frank', 3, 95000.00);



Query:

 Method 1: Using CTE

 WITH CTE AS (SELECT d.DepartmentID as dept_id,departmentname as dept_name,employeename as emp_name,Salary,RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY d.DepartmentID ORDER BY Salary desc) as Top_paid_salary
FROM Departments d
JOIN Employees e
ON d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID
)
SELECT dept_id,dept_name,emp_name,salary
FROM CTE
WHERE Top_paid_salary = 1


Method 2: Using Sub query

SELECT 
    d.DepartmentName,
    e.EmployeeName,
    e.Salary
FROM 
    Employees e
JOIN 
    Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE 
    (e.DepartmentID, e.Salary) IN (
        SELECT 
            DepartmentID, 
            MAX(Salary) 
        FROM 
            Employees 
        GROUP BY 
            DepartmentID
    );
